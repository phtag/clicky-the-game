# Homework - Week 16


### Overview
This application is a memory game created using the React framework. It has components for the navigation bar, an overview section, cards where a collection of images are displayed and a wrapper to contain all the components. The application is a game and the objective of the game is to try and click as many of the images only once to get the highest total score possible. Each time an image is clicked that has not been clicked before, 1 point is added to your score. When an image is clicked that was already clicked during the session, the score is reset to 0. The challenge of this game is that the ordering of the images is randomly shuffled each time an image is clicked. So this game is a memory challenge. 

###Purpose
The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a React application that has multiple components, passes properties and updates state when DOM elements are clicked.
